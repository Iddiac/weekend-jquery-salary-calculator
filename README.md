## Description

we calucated the monthly cost for our for our employees based on their annual salaries.
I solved it first by finding out the yearly salarys of each employee using inputs and then saving the results to the dom. Then i calculated how much each employee would be by deviding the annual salary by 12 and then appending that to dom.
